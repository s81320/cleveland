when selecting (hopefully) representative trees one wants the trees to be diverse / uncorrelated. And why not choose trees that perform well / above average rather than poorly?

To have a basis to decide which tree performs well we evaluate their perfomance on a validation set. We expect performance (accuracy) on the validation and the test set (or one might call it the second validation set) to be comparable, positively correlated, and would like to se a strong correlation.

This is not what I found. And this is probably what is refered to as 'decision trees are not robust'.
