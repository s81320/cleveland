Extracting Representative Tree Models from a Forest: http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~edgeorge/Research_papers/forestCART.pdf

The paper is more interested in interpretation than in performance. Interpretation is hard to do with a forest or an ensemble of trees. 
But if one can extract trees that represent the forest well then by interpreting the extracted trees one can claim an interpretation of the forest.

What if we can extract trees and build a small sub-forest with a similar performance (accuracy) as the full tree? 
In production we could make faster classifications.
