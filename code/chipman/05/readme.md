metrices are now scaled to be in the unit interval

* We will look at how trees are distributed over the unit square in a 2dim mds in the different metrices.
* We will check if there are natural clusters in the tree space (now the unit square) 
ie if the tree distribution over the tree space is multimodal (or not, then unimodal)
